A clever riddle or puzzle,
Challenging the mind to unravel,
Requiring focus and wit to solve,
Often leading to a satisfying "aha" moment,
Sometimes even causing frustration and confusion,
Testing one's skills and mental dexterity,
Inviting creativity and imagination to the fore, and
Championing the joy of discovery.
