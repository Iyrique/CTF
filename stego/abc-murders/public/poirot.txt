My name is Captain Arthur Hastings. My‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬ wife and I have a large farm in South‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ America, but before ‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‬I was married I lived ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌﻿in London. There‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‌ I helped‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‬ my friend, the ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬﻿famous ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‬Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, solve many ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌‬crimes.

Poirot used‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‍ to work with ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬the police in Belgium, but he retired ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌‌‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿several years ago. Since retiring,‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌﻿ though, he has become ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‌a‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‍ ‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‬very successful private detective. ‌‌‌‌‍‌﻿﻿When the‌‌‌‌‍‌﻿‌ British police have a difficult crime which they cannot‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌﻿ solve, ‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿they often ask Poirot ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‍to help them‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌‍.

In June ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌﻿1935 I ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌‌came back to Britain ‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿for six months on‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‬ business while my ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‍wife stayed in ‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿South America to manage the farm.‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‍ I didn't‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿ know that, during that time, I was going ‌‌‌‌‍‌‍‬to ‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‌work‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‍ with‌‌‌‌‍‬‍﻿ my ‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿old friend Poirot again.

Most‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‬ of this ‌‌‌‌‍‬‍﻿story is my‌‌‌‌‍‬‍﻿ own personal experience. ‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌Sometimes, though, I have included information‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‬ about events‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬ when I was not present myself. But ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬I believe I have described the thoughts and feelings of the‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‬ other people ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‌in the story correctly. Poirot ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‌has seen my work‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‍, and agrees that I have.

In my‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‌ opinion, Poirot used‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‬his skills‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬ in a most‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌ clever and ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬unusual way to solve a number of crimes which‌‌‌‌‍﻿﻿‍ were different from any others that he had worked on. I shall call these crimes the ABC Murders.
